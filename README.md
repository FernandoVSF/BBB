# Belly Button Biodiversity
  Analysis of Belly Button Bacterial Data
  
## Overview of the analysis
In this project, we are using Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web. Together with the panel for demographic information, there's a visualization of the bacterial data for each volunteer.  The volunteers are able to to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.  This way, if a species is identified as candidate to manafacture synthetic beef, volunteers are able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. The completed work is displayed in the portfolio below.
The following outputs will be produced:

- Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
- Create a Bubble Chart
- Create a Gauge Chart
- Customize the Dashboard

- Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- A written report on the UFO analysis
  
## Resources
- Data Source: data JavaScripy file
- Software: JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, VSCode

## Results
This page provides fully functional filters, using multiple criteria, that allows user's interaction as shown in the example below:

  - Initial Page
  
![initial](/initial.png)

   - Filtering by Shape = light
  
![f1](/f1_shape.png)
  
   - Adding filter by State = ca
  
![f2](/f2_state.png)

   - Adding filter by City = el cajon
  
![f3](/f3_city.png)

   - Adding filter by Date = 1/1/2010
  
![f4](/f4_date.png)
 
## Summary

One drawback of this design is that it requires the user to scroll over the whole list to select the input for the search criteria.  Another one is not being possible to reset filters (although we can select a new criteria for the filter).

As a recomendation for further dvelopments, I suggest the following:

  - Implementing combo boxes in the input fields, to show the possible selections and avoiding typos;
  
  - Implementing an option to reset filters, by "showing all" in the combo box suggested above.
