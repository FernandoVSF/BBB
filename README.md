# Belly Button Biodiversity
  Analysis of Belly Button Bacterial Data
  
## Overview of the analysis
In this project, we are using Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web. Together with the panel for demographic information, there's a visualization of the bacterial data for each volunteer.  The volunteers are able to to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.  This way, if a species is identified as candidate to manafacture synthetic beef, volunteers are able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. The completed work is displayed in the portfolio below.
The following outputs will be produced:

- Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
- Create a Bubble Chart
- Create a Gauge Chart
- Customize the Dashboard
  
## Resources
- Data Source: Samples JSON file
- Software: Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, VSCode
